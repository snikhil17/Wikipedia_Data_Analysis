# Wikipedia_Data_Analysis
## This repository contains my day-to-day practice on wikipedia module in Python:
### Day1:
- Importing the library.
- Searching over a topic - Climate change
- Using NLP to find some insights on it
- Visualize the result in Neo4j to extract graphical relation on the topic selected.
